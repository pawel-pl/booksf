 * All the parent-child relations would remain same except those who are parents of that leaf node .i.e, the parent of the leaf node , its parent ,
 * and so on till the root . 
 * Their relationship will be reversed . The parent will become child and vice versa . 
 * To get the modified tree , just reverse that one chain of leaf's parents . It can be done easily by swapping the leaf with the root ,
 * leaf parent with the root child and so on . 
 * A diagram could explain more properly . Hope this helps .

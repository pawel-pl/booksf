 * Well when the rock was on boat the amount of water displayed by it was equal to the volume of water equal to rocks mass (Archimedes Principle).
 * When the rock sinked to the bottom the amount of water displayed by it was equivalent to the volume of the rock.
 * 
 * yes, and that would imply the level of water will decrese, since the volume of rock will be less than the volume of water
 * equivalent to that weight to the rock.
 * 
 * If the volume of stone under water is bigger the then volume of water equal rocks mass the the water lever the water lever increase

 * Density decides about zanurz

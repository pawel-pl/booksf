 * Can construct "A Tree" but not the same tree for which the pre-order traversal is given. 

 Atleast two kinds of traversals are required to construct back the tree, reason? 

 ---- Each node has two nodes "letf" and "right" ie, two unknowns thus atleast two expression / fittings required to find them :)
 
 - Only BST like serialize pass range for node and compare

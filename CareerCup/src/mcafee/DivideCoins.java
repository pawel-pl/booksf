 * For any given number, divide them into two group of equal number. 
 * Say we have 20 Coins, and we have to divide them into 10-10's Group, 

 * First 10 would contain say x Heads, and ( 10 - x ) tails. 
 * while other group would contain ( 10 - x ) heads and x Tails. 

 * Just flip one Group totally, and it would be same as the other Group. in other words, 
 * x heads and ( 10 - x ) tails would convert into ( 10 - x ) heads and x tails. which is similar to other group

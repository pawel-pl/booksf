 * Many systems model it as a tree, where each file is a node. 
 * Directories are then treated as a type of file that can hold other files 
 * (nodes in the tree that can be parent nodes to other nodes). 
 * All non-directories are leaf nodes in such a system. 
 * File systems are usually hierarchical, so a tree is a logical choice for such systems.

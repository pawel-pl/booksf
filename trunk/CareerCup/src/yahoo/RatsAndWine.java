 * Best case scenario is 1 where all 10 rats drinks poisoned wine and die.
 * But the worst case scenario will be when 9 rats die because of drinking 
 * first 10 wine bottles of stack and now we are left of only 1 rat to check next 990 wine bottles. 
 * So it'll take 989[worst case] tries, which makes worst scenario as 990 tries.

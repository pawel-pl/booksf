/*
 * Ok heres the solution. SantiagoYMG is pretty close.
 * The solution is O(n) in time complexity.
 *
 * Make all of them stand in a row.
 * Lets say the people are a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,.......n
 *
 * Compare a and b.
 * if a knows b => a is certainly not the celebrity. Probable celebrity = b
 * if a doesnt know b => b is certainly not the celebrity. Probable celebrity = a

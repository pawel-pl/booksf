 * Find the shortest path between any two nodes. Let them be A and B. 
 Now to get second shortest path between the same nodes, 
 remove any one edge that is involved in the shortest path between the same nodes
 and calculate the shortest path. Do the above process for each of the node involved in
 shortest path and keep track of the minimum second shortest path found.

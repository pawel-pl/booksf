 * You have eight balls all of the same size. 6 of them weigh the same, and two of them weighs slightly more.
 * How can you find the balls that is heavier by using a balance and do this in minimum number of steps?
 * 4
 * 
 * divide the 8 balls in 3 groups 
 say .. group A => 3 balls 
 group B=> 3 balls 
 group C =>2 balls 

 put group a and b on balance .. 
 case 1) A = B .. implies either both a and b have the one heavy ball or group c have both the balls 
 so choose any two balls from any one of the group ie. A or B (suppose i chose group A) and weigh them against group C ..

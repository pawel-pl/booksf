 * 1. Sort arrival and departure times in increasing order. 
 * 2. Starting from the first element in the sorted array add 1 when an arrival time is encountered, 
 * subtract 1 when a departure time is encountered. By this way find the max. number of people that are at the party 
 * at the same time which gives the min. number of glasses needed. 
 * 
 * Time complexity of 2nd step is linear. 1st step depends on the sort algo chosen.

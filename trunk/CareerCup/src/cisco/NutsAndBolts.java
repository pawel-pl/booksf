 * 1. lets take a random nut and compare with all bolts. after this exercise you will get one match that will fit with nut, one group of bolts those are bigger than nut and another group which is smaller than nut. 
 2. now compare the matching bolt with all other nuts in the same group, here also we get two groups.. one is bigger group and another is smaller group 
 3. finally we get one nut-bolt match and one group of nuts and bolts those are smaller than the match nut-bolt and another group of nuts and bolts those are bigger than the match nut-bolt combination 
 4. now apply recursion on both smaller and bigger groups... do this till all matches found 
 5. finally we get nut-bolt match combinations and also those are sorted.
